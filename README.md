# Physv

Physv is a basic physics engine based off of [Flat Physics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSlpr6o9vURwq3oxVZSimY8iC-cdd3kIs) but modified to suit a more modular workflow and adapted to be more inline with the [Vala](https://vala.dev/) syntax.

### Why not just use Box2C?

Because why not? Is Box2C going to be better? Yes, is it going to have more features and polish? Also yes.

But sometimes it's fun to use something out of the normal.
